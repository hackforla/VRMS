# Volunteer Relationship Management System
Live Site: [https://vrms.io](https://vrms.io)

VRMS is a tool used for the engagement, support, and retention of a network of volunteers.

This is an ambitious project to create a system that will help us measure our human capital development, reduce repetitive tasks and processes for leadership, and improve outcomes for both volunteers and the projects they contribute to.
